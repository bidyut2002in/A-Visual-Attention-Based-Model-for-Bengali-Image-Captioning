Dataset
We have used two datasets Bangla Lekha Image Captions (BLIC) [1] and Bangla Natural Language Image to Text (BNLIT) [2] to train the captioning model in Bengali.

Automatic assessment of learning is a process where the computer system automatically generates test i tems and evaluates the responses. Image is one of the major media to assess learning capabilities. In this article, we have proposed a system with a dataset containing images used to evaluate the kid’s ability to answer pictorial questions. The system tests a set of skills such as counting ability, color concept, and knowledge of objects and geometric shapes. It utilized a pipeline of RCNN and LSTM bridging with an object knowledge layer for generating question–answer pairs and achieved promising results. We benchmarked our dataset with state-of-the-art deep learning methods and assessed the performance of generating question–answer pairs from a given image.
